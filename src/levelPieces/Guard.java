 * Purpose: used to create a guard gamepiece for the KerPlop Game
 * Responsibilities: Interacts with the player by killing the player if the player is within
 * one block of it. For each interaction either a kill occurs or no interaction
 * occurs. Also patrols near its starting square within the gameboard. This class 
 * overrides the interfaces and abstract classes it inherits
