Requirements:
- 5 Pieces that Interact:
	* Archer -- will shoot an arrow randomly in a random direction. If this arrow is in
				range of the player, it will cause a hit, if not, do nothing
	* Guard -- will kill the player if within one space of it. If not in vicinity, do nothing
	* Magic Carpet -- if the player occupies the same space, will cause ADVANCE interaction. If
					  not in vicinity, do nothing
	* ThornBush -- will hit the player if the player occupies the same space. If not in 
				   vicinity, do nothing
	* Treasure -- will give the player a point if the player occupies the same space or an
				  adjacent space. If not in vicinity, do nothing
	* The five pieces listed account for every interaction result. Pieces ThornBush, Treasure
	  and MagicCarpet do not move while Archer and Guard do. Archer interacts at a distance
	  
- 2 Different Move Algorithms:
	* Archer -- moves randomly within the bounds of the board
	* Guard -- patrols within 2 spaces of its original location
	* The two pieces listed have two different move algorithms and the Archer piece involves
	random movement

- 1 Drawable Piece:
	* Door -- not a gamepiece and does not implement Moveable. This piece exists on the board
	without doing anything.
